Yes, now Christmas is not celebrated in Japan. December the 25th and 26th are not public holidays. But some families sit down and eat a bucket of fried chicken. Really? Why? Well, it started in 1974. The fast food chain can tucky fried chicken. KFC. Yes, KFC. They came up with a new tradition. Something to do at Christmas in Japan. Have a party barrel. What's inside the party barrel? Fried chicken, chips and pudding, which is ice cream or cheesecake. It's really, really popular. In Sweden, on the 13th of December, they celebrate Saint Lucia. Children dress up in white and one little girl, she is Saint Lucia. She has candles on her head. Candles on her head. Why? So she can hold the food. She gives people delicious buns, cake and biscuits. She is the light in the middle of a dark winter. Right, okay. Is it a holiday? No, no, but it's a very important day. Now, the 8th of December is body day. It's an important day for Buddhists, right? So in China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, they all celebrate this day. Yeah, and there are different ways, aren't there, to celebrate the day. Meditation, helping others. Or even just a simple meal of rice and milk. Or a visit to a temple. And of course, to put colorful lights around the Bodhi tree. And is it a holiday? Only in some countries. So what do you do in December?
